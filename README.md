# Delivery App

This project is a simple delivery app developed using React and a custom backend
built with Node.js. The app allows users to order goods from various shops and
track the status of their orders.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this app, make sure you have the following software
installed:

- [Node.js] - (recommended version 14.x.x)
- npm (recommended version 6.x.x) or Yarn (recommended version 1.x.x)]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/delivery-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd delivery-app
```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

4. Navigate to the backend folder and install the backend dependencies:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

## Configuration

Before running the app, you need to configure some parameters.

1. Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add the following
   values:

```bash
DB_URI=
PORT=3000
```

Note that we are using a MongoDB database with the URL
[mongodb://localhost:27017/delivery_app]. You can change this URL to your own if
you're using a different database. 2. Fill in other configuration parameters
that may be required for your backend, such as API keys, authentication
settings, etc.

## Usage

Now that the app is set up, you can use it by following these steps:

1. Start the backend server. In the backend folder, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

The server will be running on the port specified in the .env file. 2. Start the
frontend. Go back to the project's root folder and run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

The app will be running in development mode and will open in your browser at
http://localhost:3001 (or a different port if you changed it in the .env file).

## Conclusion

Delivery App is a simple example of a delivery app developed using React and
Node.js. You can use it as a starting point and build upon it to add more
features according to your needs.
